       Escrow − A simple password Escrow service.

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
       The Escrow service handles the task of providing a secure place to
       store data (often passwords).  It works by creating a layer of obfusca‐
       tion between the actual password and the user.

IINNSSTTAALLLL
         $ perl ‐MCPAN ‐e ’install Escrow’
         $ sudo mkdir ‐p /etc/escrow/data/old
         $ sudo mkdir ‐p /etc/escrow/db

       You will then need to grab the files from the conf/ directory (in the
       source distribution) and place them in /etc/escrow.  The Makefile
       should go in /etc/escrow/data.

UUSSAAGGEE
       Populate /etc/escrow/data/escrow with Config::General hashes, like
       this:

           <thing>
               one = two
               two = three
           </thing>

       Then run "make", or "escrow".  Make will do some handy things for you,
       like ensuring the permissions are set properly.

       Finally, run the escrow service:

          $ sudo /usr/bin/escrow‐service

       And then ask for your data:

          $ descrow ‐s http://localhost:19999 ‐r ‐t thing

WWAARRNNIINNGG
       You will want to change the configuration settings, since things will
       get janky on you otherwise.  Specifically, you want to set your own
       secret in both "escrow−service.conf" and "escrow−client.conf".  You
       also want to make sure you set the permissions properly on
       escrow−client.conf and escrow−service.conf. (They should be pretty
       restrictive)

       In addition, make sure you have "astext" set to 0 when you are in pro‐
       duction. :)

BBUUGGSS
       Removing a thing from escrow does not delete it from the compiled data‐
       base.  You can fix this by just rm‐ing the actual database before run‐
       ning "escrow".

       Marchex, Inc. was my employer when I wrote this code, and they gra‐
       ciously open sourced it.  Thanks, Marchex!
